# Youtube-to-Spotify


**Description**  
A program that copies all playlists from a Youtube account (including Youtube Music) into a Spotify account.
I used Python because it was (and currently is) compatible with the Youtube and Spotify API.
The main challenge I faced was figuring out OAuth to access a user's Youtube and Spotify accounts.

**STEPS**  
**1.** Download zip and unpack it  
**2.** Get your client_secret.json and add the email linked to your Youtube as a test user through Google Developer Console  
**3.** Get your secrets.py from Spotify for Developers (the Spotify OAuth token must be re-generated after a few minutes)

**4.** Run youtospot.py on command prompt

**5.** Using link generated, Copy and paste it into the browser and get the authorization code

**6.** Your playlists will then be copied onto your spotify account!
